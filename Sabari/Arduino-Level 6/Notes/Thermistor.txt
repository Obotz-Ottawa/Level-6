Thermistor:

It is a two terminal analog deivce which is used to measure temperature. It is bidirectional and the resistance pf the thermistor changes with the change in temperature.

2 types of Thermistors:

1) Positive temprature coefficient(PTC) Thermistor
2) Negative temperature coeffcient(NTC) Thermistor

In PTC, the temperature directly proportional to the resistance of the therminstor.

Resistance increases, temperature also increases and vice versa

In NTC thermistors, the temperature is inversly proportional to the resistance of the thermistor.

We will be using NTC thermistor of 10 Kilo Ohm. 
10 Kilo Ohm resitance -> 25 degress Celcius

Timer/Counter Control Register A(TCCRnA)
TCCRnA is used to set the mode in which we want to operate the timer. It is also used to set the prescaler.


Timer/Counter Control RegisterB(TCCRnB)
TCCRnB is an extenstion of TCCRnA. It holds the bits for the mode with which the timer wants to operate and also for holding the bits for the prescaler.

Prescaler:
A prescaler is an electronic counting circuit used to reduce a high frequency electrical signal to a lower freqeuncy by integer division. The purpose of the prescaler is to allow the timer to be clocked at the rate a user desires

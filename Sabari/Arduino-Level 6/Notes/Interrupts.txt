Interrupts:

The microcontroller needs a mechanism where it can recieve a signal when an error is occurred. THis is doe by the interrupts inside the microcontroller.
It interrupts the normal sequence of the program and indicates the microcontroller to cheeck for the event that caused the interrupt

1) Hardware or External Interrupts
2) Software interrupts

Software Interrupts:

Interrupts generated by setting various registers or there are few specific overflows. Using timers and USART.

Once the interrupt is generated, the microcontroller has to execute a series of tasks. These tasks are specidied in an "INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE(ISR)". Every interrupt has a unique name along with its unique ISR name

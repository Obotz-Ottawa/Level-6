Timers in ATMega 324

There are 3 timers/counters; 2-8 bit 1 16-bit.

TC0 and TC2 are 8 bit Timers/counters
TC1 is a 16-bit timer/counter

The 8-bit timers/counters have a range of 0-255, 2^8

The 16 bit timer/counter can count upto 65,535(2^16-1)

Registers:
1) Timer/Counter Control Register = TCCR
2) timer/counter register - TCR
3) Output Compare register - OCR
4) Timer interrupt Mask register - TIMSK
